	<h3> Let's learn CSS! As in HTML, you can make headers,</h3>
	<p id = "tay"> ...You can write paragraphs, </p>
	<h1> ......You can make really big headers, </h1>
	<p id ="style"> And more! Why not make a list?  Here are some fun board games: </p>
	<ul id ="borders">
		<li> Monopoly  </li>
		<li> Chess  </li>
		<li> Clue  </li>
		<li> Life  </li>
	</ul>

	<p id ="list"> What if I want to order the list? We can do that too! </p>
	<ol>
		<li> Clue  </li>
		<li id ="style"> Monopoly8  </li>
		<li id ="tay"> Chess  </li>
		<li> Life  </li>
	</ol>

	<h2> Isn't CSS great?  It doesn't seem different, but the code is easier to understand because the formatting is separate. Let's see some more formatting!</h2>
	<p id ="list"> I am <em> so </em> hungry right now.  I <strong> really </strong> wish it were lunch right now.<p>
	<div id = "style"> Speaking of lunch, here are some good foods: </div>
	<ul>
		<li> Pizza </li>
		<li> Blueberries</li>
		<li id ="rasp"> Raspberry pie</li>
	</ul>
	<div> You can also add pictures! </div>
	<img src="image.png"/>
	<h2 id = "end"> Thanks for learning CSS with us!</h2>
